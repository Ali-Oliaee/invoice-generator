# University Project: HTML, CSS Template with Node.js (Express) Server

### Project Overview

This project is developed as part of a university assignment aimed at building a foundational web application. The application utilizes a simple HTML and CSS template for the front-end interface and is powered by a Node.js server, using the Express framework, for the back-end functionality.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Front-End Development: To design and implement a user interface using HTML and CSS that adheres to modern web standards.
2. Back-End Development: To create a basic server-side application using Node.js and the Express framework.
3. Integration: To integrate the front-end and back-end components, ensuring seamless interaction between the user interface and server-side logic.
4. Educational Purpose: To provide hands-on experience with fundamental web development technologies, enhancing understanding of full-stack development processes.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages and content.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the web pages.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to handle routing and server-side logic.
